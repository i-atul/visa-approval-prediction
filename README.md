# Visa Prediction Project 

## Overview
Welcome to the **Visa Prediction Project**! This project integrates  **Machine Learning (ML)** to streamline the process of predicting visa application approvals or rejections. By leveraging MLOps best practices, we ensure efficient model development, automation, and seamless version control, making the system robust, scalable, and production-ready.

## Key Features
- **End-to-End MLOps Pipeline:** Ensures structured and automated ML workflows.
- **State-of-the-Art ML Models:** Utilizes cutting-edge algorithms for high accuracy.
- **Data Pipeline Automation:** Handles ingestion, validation, transformation, and feature engineering.
- **Model Versioning & Storage:** Automatically pushes trained models to **AWS S3** for efficient storage and retrieval.
- **Scalability & Performance:** Designed to process large datasets with optimized performance.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into modular components, each contributing to an efficient ML workflow:

### 1. Setup
Contains scripts and instructions to:
- Set up the project environment
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Configure **MongoDB Atlas** for data storage

### 2. Data Ingestion
Components for:
- Fetching and loading visa application data from Kaggle( [EasyVisa Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moro23/easyvisa-dataset) ).
- Storing processed data in **MongoDB Atlas** for further use

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering
- Provides Jupyter notebooks for in-depth EDA and feature selection.
- Identifies key variables affecting visa approval/rejection.
- Implements preprocessing techniques such as encoding, scaling, and handling missing values.

### 4. Data Validation
- Ensures the integrity and quality of ingested data.
- Implements schema validation and consistency checks before model training.

### 5. Data Transformation
- Converts raw data into a machine-learning-friendly format.
- Includes feature extraction, normalization, and encoding mechanisms.

### 6. Model Training
- Trains multiple machine learning models using automated scripts.
- Performs hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and performance evaluation.

### 7. Model Evaluation
- Compares model performance using standardized evaluation metrics.
- Generates reports and visualizations for model comparison.

### 8. Model Versioning & Storage (AWS S3)
- Once a model is trained, it is automatically pushed to an **AWS S3 bucket** for:
  - Efficient storage and retrieval.
  - Version control and reproducibility.
- Ensures smooth transition between model iterations without manual intervention.

## Implementation Highlights
This project follows industry-grade MLOps practices, including:


### **1. Automated Model Pushing to AWS S3**
- Implements a **Model Pusher** component that automatically uploads trained models to an **AWS S3 bucket**.
- Enables seamless version tracking and storage management.

### **2. Cloud Integration (AWS Services)**
- Uses **AWS S3** for storing trained models.
- Provides a scalable infrastructure for handling ML workflows efficiently.

## Usage
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Set up the environment:**
   - Create a virtual environment.
   - Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Configure MongoDB Atlas:**
   - Sign up for **MongoDB Atlas**.
   - Create a new project and configure database settings.

3. **Load Data:**
   - Fetch Kaggle data from Kaggle.
   - Use the provided scripts to push data into **MongoDB Atlas**.

4. **Perform EDA & Feature Engineering:**
   - Analyze data using Jupyter notebooks.
   - Preprocess features to enhance model performance.

5. **Train the ML Model:**
   - Run the model training scripts.
   - Optimize hyperparameters and evaluate models.

6. **Push the Trained Model to AWS S3:**
   - The best-performing model is automatically uploaded to **AWS S3**.
   - Enables model version control and future retrieval.



### ðŸ“Œ Note:
This project **does not** include CI/CD or direct deployment processes. The primary focus is on **model training, evaluation, and storage in AWS S3**, ensuring streamlined MLOps implementation.
